## Periodic Homogenization

Periodic Homogenization relates to the art of solving PDEs in materials with a periodic intern structure. 
An ansatz is basically formulated, and the resolution usually requires two steps at first order; solving the
**cell problem** and then the **homogenized problem**. The method overall is quite similar to what is done
in a standard Galerkin method, but the speed of convergence of the ansatz towards the true solution is a complicated
question.
